## Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** with a feature-first folder structure.

```
lib/
└── app/
    ├── config/          # DI, base state, interceptors, local storage
    ├── core/            # Routes, theme, endpoints, shared widgets
    └── feature/         # 12 feature modules
        ├── auth/
        ├── apply_driver/
        ├── home/
        ├── home_tab/
        ├── orders/
        ├── track_order/
        ├── map_tracking/
        ├── profile/
        └── ...
```

Each feature is divided into three layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Data** | DTOs, Retrofit API clients, remote data sources, repository implementations |
| **Domain** | Entities, repository contracts, use cases |
| **Presentation** | Screens, widgets, Cubit/ViewModel, states, events |

## The Flowery Ecosystem

This app is one half of a complete flower delivery platform:

| App | Description | Repo |
|-----|-------------|------|
| **Flowery** | Customer app — browse, order, and track flower deliveries | [IslamRamzy444/flowery_store_app](https://github.com/IslamRamzy444/flowery_store_app) |
| **Flowery Rider** (this repo) | Driver app — receive orders, navigate, and update delivery status | [momenhaitham/flowery_rider_application](https://github.com/momenhaitham/flowery_rider_application) |

Both apps communicate in real time via **Cloud Firestore** for live order tracking and driver location updates.
